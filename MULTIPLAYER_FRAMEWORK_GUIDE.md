# Multiplayer Framework Guide

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive multiplayer framework built for the game portal using Colyseus. The framework provides a unified system for all multiplayer games with consistent features across different game types.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Colyseus Server** (`server/multiplayer-server.js`)
   - Main multiplayer server handling WebSocket connections
   - Room management and matchmaking
   - Game state synchronization

2. **Base Game Room** (`server/rooms/BaseGameRoom.js`)
   - Abstract base class for all game rooms
   - Handles common multiplayer features (lobby, countdown, results, etc.)
   - Provides lifecycle management

3. **Game Lobby** (`server/rooms/GameLobby.js`)
   - Central matchmaking hub
   - Room discovery and creation
   - Quick match functionality

4. **Client SDK** (`public/js/multiplayer-sdk.js`)
   - Unified client interface for all games
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Game-specific extensions

### Room Lifecycle

All multiplayer games follow the same lifecycle:

```
LOBBY â†’ COUNTDOWN â†’ PLAYING â†’ RESULTS â†’ RESET/REMATCH
```

#### States Explained

- **LOBBY**: Players join, set ready status, host can start
- **COUNTDOWN**: 5-second countdown before game starts
- **PLAYING**: Active gameplay with real-time synchronization
- **RESULTS**: Show final scores and rankings
- **RESET**: Return to lobby for rematch or new players

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Universal Features (All Games)

- **Authentication Integration**: Works with existing auth system
- **Lobby System**: Join/create rooms, ready status, host controls
- **Matchmaking**: Quick match, private rooms with codes, public room browser
- **Room Lifecycle**: Consistent state management across all games
- **Reconnection**: 30-second reconnection window with state preservation
- **AFK Detection**: Automatic removal of inactive players
- **Real-time Sync**: 60fps client updates, optimized server tick rates
- **Results & Rematch**: Comprehensive scoring and rematch voting

### ðŸ”’ Room Management

- **Public Rooms**: Discoverable through matchmaking
- **Private Rooms**: 6-character room codes for friends
- **Host Migration**: Automatic host reassignment on disconnect
- **Player Limits**: Configurable min/max players per game
- **Room Persistence**: Rooms stay alive during player reconnections

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

- **Health Checks**: Server status monitoring
- **Room Statistics**: Active rooms, player counts
- **Performance Metrics**: Connection quality, latency tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery

## Game Integration

### Creating a New Multiplayer Game

1. **Create Game Room Class**:
```javascript
const { BaseGameRoom } = require('./BaseGameRoom');

class MyGameRoom extends BaseGameRoom {
  onCreate(options = {}) {
    super.onCreate(options);
    // Game-specific initialization
  }

  onGameMessage(client, type, message) {
    // Handle game-specific messages
  }

  onGameStart() {
    // Game-specific start logic
  }

  onGameReset() {
    // Game-specific reset logic
  }
}
```

2. **Register Room Type**:
```javascript
// In multiplayer-server.js
gameServer.define('my_game', MyGameRoom);
```

3. **Create Client Integration**:
```javascript
class MyGameSDK extends MultiplayerSDK {
  // Game-specific client methods
  performGameAction(data) {
    this.sendGameMessage('game_action', data);
  }
}
```

### Existing Game Examples

#### Snake Battle (`SnakeRoom`)
- Real-time movement synchronization
- Combat system with projectiles
- Power-ups and special foods
- Session-based gameplay (5-minute rounds)

#### Box Jump Challenge (`BoxJumpRoom`)
- Turn-based gameplay
- Level progression system
- Elimination mechanics
- Performance tracking

## Client SDK Usage

### Basic Setup

```javascript
// Initialize SDK
const sdk = new MultiplayerSDK({
  serverUrl: 'ws://localhost:3002'
});

// Set up event handlers
sdk.on('room_joined', ({ playerId, roomCode, isHost }) => {
  console.log(`Joined room ${roomCode} as ${isHost ? 'host' : 'player'}`);
});

sdk.on('game_started', () => {
  console.log('Game started!');
});

sdk.on('game_update', (gameState) => {
  // Update game visuals
  updateGameDisplay(gameState);
});
```

### Room Management

```javascript
// Create private room
await sdk.createRoom('snake', { 
  isPrivate: true,
  settings: { difficulty: 'hard' }
});

// Quick match
await sdk.quickMatch('snake');

// Join private room
await sdk.joinPrivateRoom('ABC123');

// Set ready status
sdk.setReady(true);

// Start game (host only)
sdk.startGame();
```

### Game-Specific Actions

```javascript
// Snake game
const snakeSDK = new SnakeMultiplayerSDK();
snakeSDK.move('UP');
snakeSDK.shoot();
snakeSDK.activateArmor();

// Box Jump game
const boxJumpSDK = new BoxJumpMultiplayerSDK();
boxJumpSDK.levelCompleted();
boxJumpSDK.playerDied();
boxJumpSDK.finishTurn();
```

## Server Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Server Configuration
MULTIPLAYER_PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=production

# Redis Configuration (optional)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security
