# PWA Configuration Summary

## Task 17: Update Next.js configuration for PWA - COMPLETED

### 1. PWA Settings and Optimizations ✅

**next.config.js** has been configured with:
- `next-pwa` integration with proper settings
- Service worker registration and scope configuration
- Runtime caching strategies for different asset types
- Mobile-specific build optimizations

### 2. Mobile-Specific Build Optimizations ✅

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Image optimization with WebP/AVIF formats
- Bundle splitting for better caching
- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- SWC minification enabled
- Modular imports for reduced bundle size
- Webpack optimizations for mobile devices

**Caching Strategies:**
- App Shell: Cache First (30 days)
- Game Assets: Stale While Revalidate (7 days)
- Images: Cache First (30 days)
- Audio: Cache First (30 days)
- API calls: Network First with 3s timeout (5 minutes)
- General content: Network First (24 hours)

### 3. Service Worker Scope and Caching Rules ✅

**Service Worker Configuration:**
- Scope: `/` (entire application)
- Auto-registration enabled
- Skip waiting enabled for immediate updates
- Comprehensive runtime caching rules

**Cache Names:**
- `app-shell-cache`: Core application files
- `game-assets-cache`: Game-specific assets
- `images-cache`: Static images
- `audio-cache`: Sound files
- `api-cache`: API responses
- `general-cache`: Other content

### 4. Additional Features Implemented ✅

**Security Headers:**
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Offline Support:**
- Created `/public/offline.html` fallback page
- Offline game detection and listing
- Auto-retry connection mechanism

**Build Verification:**
- PWA compilation successful
- Service worker generated at `/sw.js`
- Workbox integration working
- All caching strategies active

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 1.1**: PWA installation and standalone mode ✅
- **Requirement 3.1**: Offline functionality with caching ✅  
- **Requirement 5.1**: Mobile performance optimizations ✅

## Files Modified/Created

1. `next.config.js` - Complete PWA configuration
2. `public/offline.html` - Offline fallback page
3. `package.json` - Added next-pwa dependency

## Build Status

✅ PWA compilation successful
✅ Service worker generated
✅ Runtime caching configured
✅ Mobile optimizations active

The Next.js PWA configuration is complete and functional. The application now supports:
- Progressive Web App installation
- Offline functionality with intelligent caching
- Mobile-optimized performance
- Comprehensive service worker integration
