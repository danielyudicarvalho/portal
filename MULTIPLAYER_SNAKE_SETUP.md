### File Structure
```
src/app/games/snake-multiplayer/page.tsx    # Game page component
public/games/snake-multiplayer/index.html   # Game HTML
public/games/snake-multiplayer/game.js      # Client-side game logic
server/snake-server.js                      # WebSocket game server
```

### Dependencies Added
- `express`: Web server framework
- `socket.io`: Real-time WebSocket communication

## Troubleshooting

### Game won't connect
- Make sure the snake server is running on port 3001
- Check that both servers are started
- Verify no firewall is blocking the ports

### Performance issues
- The game runs at 150ms intervals for optimal performance
- Reduce the number of players if experiencing lag
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Port conflicts
- Change the snake server port by setting `SNAKE_PORT` environment variable
- Update the client connection URL in `game.js` if using a different port

## Development

### Adding new features
1. Server logic goes in `server/snake-server.js`
2. Client logic goes in `public/games/snake-multiplayer/game.js`
3. UI updates go in `src/app/games/snake-multiplayer/page.tsx`

### Testing multiplayer
- Open multiple browser tabs/windows
- Use different browsers
- Test with friends on the same network
- Use browser dev tools to simulate different network conditions

## Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Set up the snake server on a cloud platform
2. Update the socket connection URL to point to your server
3. Configure proper CORS settings
4. Set up process management (PM2, Docker, etc.)

Enjoy the multiplayer snake battle! üêç‚öîÔ∏è
