âœ… **Implemented:**
- Enhanced room monitoring interval (reduced to 3 seconds for better responsiveness)
- Comprehensive room state broadcasting to lobby clients
- Real-time capacity and state tracking
- Advanced monitoring data collection and broadcasting
- Room state transition notifications

**Key Features:**
- `broadcastRoomStateUpdate()` method for real-time state changes

- Enhanced room statistics with capacity utilization metrics
- Real-time alerts for room issues (empty, full, stuck states)

### Requirement 12.2: Health Check Endpoints
**"WHEN checking health THEN endpoints SHALL return service status"**

âœ… **Implemented:**
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with comprehensive health metrics
- New `/api/metrics` endpoint with detailed performance data
- New `/api/rooms/monitor` endpoint for real-time room monitoring
- Health status determination based on memory usage and connection counts
- Performance metrics including memory, CPU, and event loop data

**Key Features:**
- Health status classification (healthy/warning/critical)
- Memory usage percentage calculation
- Peak connection tracking
- Room capacity utilization metrics
- Automated alert generation for monitoring systems

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced GameLobby Features

   }
   ```

3. **Room State Broadcasting:**
   ```javascript
   broadcastRoomStateUpdate(roomId, newState, additionalData)
   updateRoomStatus(roomId, updates)
   getMonitoringData()
   ```

### Enhanced BaseGameRoom Features

1. **Automatic Disposal Logic:**
   ```javascript
   removePlayer(playerId) {
     // Enhanced empty room detection
     // Graceful disposal with grace period

   }
   ```

2. **Metadata Management:**
   ```javascript
   updateRoomMetadata()
   transitionToState(newState, additionalData)
   ```

3. **Enhanced Disposal Handling:**
   ```javascript
   onDispose() {
     // Lobby notification system
     // Disposal reason tracking
     // Comprehensive cleanup
   }
   ```

### Enhanced Multiplayer Server Features

1. **Advanced Health Checks:**
   ```javascript
   GET /health
   // Health status determination
   // Memory usage monitoring
   // Connection count tracking
   // Issue identification
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Metrics:**
   ```javascript
   GET /api/metrics
   // Performance monitoring
   // Room capacity statistics
   // Connection analytics
   // Event loop metrics
   ```

3. **Real-time Room Monitoring:**
   ```javascript
   GET /api/rooms/monitor
   // Live room status
   // Capacity utilization
   // Automated alerts
   // Room uptime tracking
   ```
