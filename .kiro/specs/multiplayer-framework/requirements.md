# Multiplayer Framework Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive multiplayer framework for the game portal using Colyseus. The framework provides a unified system for all multiplayer games with consistent room lifecycle management, matchmaking, and real-time synchronization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Room Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a consistent room lifecycle system so that all multiplayer games follow the same flow and provide a uniform user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL initialize it in LOBBY state
2. WHEN minimum players are ready THEN the host SHALL be able to start the game
3. WHEN a game starts THEN the system SHALL transition through COUNTDOWN → PLAYING → RESULTS states
4. WHEN a game ends THEN the system SHALL display results and allow rematch voting
5. WHEN players vote for rematch THEN the system SHALL reset to LOBBY state
6. IF no rematch occurs within 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically reset to LOBBY

### Requirement 2: Player Connection Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want reliable connection handling so that I can rejoin games if I disconnect temporarily and don't lose my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player joins a room THEN the system SHALL assign them a unique session ID
2. WHEN a player disconnects THEN the system SHALL preserve their state for 30 seconds
3. WHEN a player reconnects within 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL restore their previous state
4. WHEN a player is inactive for 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL remove them for AFK
5. IF the host disconnects THEN the system SHALL automatically assign a new host
6. WHEN a player leaves permanently THEN the system SHALL clean up their resources

### Requirement 3: Matchmaking and Room Discovery

**User Story:** As a player, I want easy ways to find and join games so that I can quickly start playing with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request quick match THEN the system SHALL find an available room or create a new one
2. WHEN I create a private room THEN the system SHALL generate a 6-character room code
3. WHEN I join by room code THEN the system SHALL validate the code and add me to the room
4. WHEN I browse public rooms THEN the system SHALL show available rooms with player counts
5. IF a room is full THEN the system SHALL prevent new players from joining
6. WHEN a room becomes empty THEN the system SHALL dispose of it automatically

### Requirement 4: Real-time Game Synchronization

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth real-time gameplay so that all players see the same game state simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game state changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all connected players
2. WHEN a player performs an action THEN the system SHALL validate it server-side
3. WHEN network latency occurs THEN the client SHALL use interpolation for smooth rendering
4. WHEN state conflicts occur THEN the server state SHALL be authoritative
5. IF a player sends invalid data THEN the system SHALL reject it and log the attempt
6. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL only send changed data

### Requirement 5: Game-Specific Implementations

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to easily create new multiplayer games so that I can focus on game logic rather than networking infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new game THEN I SHALL extend the BaseGameRoom class
2. WHEN implementing game logic THEN I SHALL override specific lifecycle methods
3. WHEN handling game messages THEN I SHALL implement the onGameMessage method
4. WHEN defining game state THEN I SHALL use Colyseus schemas for synchronization
5. IF I need custom player data THEN I SHALL extend the gameData property
6. WHEN registering the game THEN I SHALL add it to the server configuration

### Requirement 6: Snake Game Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play multiplayer Snake with combat features so that I can compete with other players in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing Snake THEN the system SHALL support 2-8 players simultaneously
2. WHEN I move my snake THEN the system SHALL update position at 150ms intervals
3. WHEN I collect food THEN my snake SHALL grow and my score SHALL increase
4. WHEN I shoot a projectile THEN it SHALL cost 5 points and move at 2x snake speed
5. WHEN I activate armor THEN it SHALL protect me for 10 seconds and cost 5 points
6. WHEN snakes collide THEN the larger snake SHALL win and gain points
7. WHEN poison food appears THEN it SHALL move randomly and kill instantly
8. WHEN a session ends after 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL show final rankings

### Requirement 7: Box Jump Game Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play turn-based Box Jump so that I can compete in a structured platformer challenge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing Box Jump THEN the system SHALL require minimum 5 players
2. WHEN it's my turn THEN I SHALL have exclusive control of the character
3. WHEN I complete a level THEN I SHALL advance to the next level
4. WHEN I die on a level THEN my death count SHALL increase
5. WHEN all players finish a round THEN players who failed SHALL be eliminated
6. WHEN only one player remains THEN they SHALL be declared the winner
7. WHEN the game ends THEN rankings SHALL be based on levels completed and death count

### Requirement 8: Client SDK Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a simple SDK so that I can easily integrate multiplayer features into game clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the SDK THEN it SHALL connect to the multiplayer server
2. WHEN creating a room THEN the SDK SHALL return a room ID and code
3. WHEN joining a room THEN the SDK SHALL handle the connection automatically
4. WHEN game events occur THEN the SDK SHALL emit appropriate events
5. WHEN sending game actions THEN the SDK SHALL provide typed methods
6. IF connection fails THEN the SDK SHALL provide error callbacks
7. WHEN reconnecting THEN the SDK SHALL restore the previous session

### Requirement 9: Docker Containerization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized deployment so that I can easily deploy and scale the multiplayer system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for development THEN Docker SHALL provide hot reload capabilities
2. WHEN building for production THEN Docker SHALL create optimized images
3. WHEN scaling THEN Redis SHALL handle presence and state management
4. WHEN deploying THEN NGINX SHALL provide reverse proxy and rate limiting
5. IF a container fails THEN the system SHALL restart it automatically
6. WHEN monitoring THEN health checks SHALL verify service status

### Requirement 10: Security and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure and performant multiplayer services so that the system can handle production traffic safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving client messages THEN the server SHALL validate all input
2. WHEN under load THEN rate limiting SHALL prevent abuse
3. WHEN in production THEN CORS SHALL restrict allowed origins
4. WHEN handling WebSocket connections THEN SSL/TLS SHALL encrypt traffic
5. IF suspicious activity occurs THEN the system SHALL log and block it
6. WHEN monitoring performance THEN metrics SHALL be available via endpoints
7. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail

### Requirement 11: Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want backward compatibility so that existing games continue working while new features are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the new framework THEN existing Socket.IO games SHALL continue working
2. WHEN migrating games THEN both old and new versions SHALL run simultaneously  
3. WHEN users access games THEN they SHALL have access to both implementations
4. WHEN testing new features THEN they SHALL not affect existing functionality
5. IF issues occur with new framework THEN users SHALL fall back to old system

### Requirement 12: Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring tools so that I can debug issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rooms are active THEN the Colyseus monitor SHALL show real-time status
2. WHEN checking health THEN endpoints SHALL return service status
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with stack traces
4. WHEN debugging THEN detailed message logs SHALL be available
5. IF performance degrades THEN metrics SHALL identify bottlenecks
6. WHEN in production THEN monitoring SHALL alert on issues
